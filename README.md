# The Nikki Minimalistic Static Site Generator

Nikki is a static site generator like [sw](http://nibble.develsec.org/projects/sw.html) but is even simpler.  It only requires standard *NIX command-line tools.  To install Nikki, run `install.sh`, passing the installation directory as the first argument.

To create a new site, create a directory and write a `config.txt` file.  Alternatively, you can copy the `config.txt` in the Nikki repo: It's fully commented.  (You can read `nikki` to figure out the `config.txt` variables' semantics: It's a short, readable script!)

To generate the site, navigate to the site's directory and run `nikki`.

Want new features?  Extend Nikki yourself.  Hooray for simple, open tools!

## License

I have dedicated all of the files in this repo to the public domain via the Creative Commons CC0 Public Domain Dedication in the hope that they would be circulated widely and without restriction.  I won't make any money from this code and I feel that it's more important that other people are free to use, modify, and distribute it as they please, with or without charge, even if I could make money from this.  Simply put, I like contributing to a healthy public domain.  See the file `COPYING` for a complete copy of the public domain dedication.

## Authors

I wrote Nikki by myself primarily for myself, but I hope that others will find it useful.
